# ee.py ([eepy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eepy))
This library just makes your program sleep whenever `eep()` is called. You can also specify a time (in seconds) and a message to send when it sleeps by passing an integer and a string to `eep()` and a message to send when it sleeps. By default sleeps between 1 and 10 seconds and the message is "goodnight"
